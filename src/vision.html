  <p>The goal of gatherspiel.com is to promote human connection through board games as a way of 
     increasing interest in public spaces.To promote this goal, these guidelines wil be followed for any changes.</p>

  <h2>Support for in person interaction</h2>

  <p>All content added to Gatherspiel will support the goal of encouraging people to interact in person. For example,
    a feature that makes it easier for people to find in person events would be a good fit for the website.
    Changes to improve usability or readability of the website also support this goal.

    Forums, comments, or any other form of online messaging will not be supported by Gatherspiel. While these
    are valuable for developing and growing a board game community, there are also many other platforms that prioritize
    these types of communication.
  </p>

  <h2>Content is human generated</h2>

  <p>As a website that promotes human connection, Gatherspiel will be generated by humans without the use
    of generative AI. This includes not using generative AI for art, text, or code.</p>


  <h2>All users see the same content</h2>

  <p>All users will see the same content, and Gatherspiel will not provide personalized recommendations. Gatherspiel
    encourages getting recommendations through connecting with others in person at events.  When users see events or
    other content on Gatherspiel, it should be because they made a decision to view that content.
  </p>

  <h2>Non Commercial</h2>

  <p>Gatherspiel will not be a profit making entity. Monetization will be minimized and only be used for the goal
    of supporting expenses associated with the platform.
  </p>

  <h2>Decentralization</h2>

  <p>While hosts can share information about their events using Gatherspiel's platform, Gatherspiel will also support
    hosting events using other platforms. Data stored on Gatherspiel will be able to be accessed and exported
    <a href="https://activitypub.rocks/">ActivityPub powered API</a>.

    All code used for the Gatherspiel platform will also be open source and will be able to be used by people
    looking to self host.
  </p>

  <p><a href="https://dmvboardgames.com/">Here</a> is a work in progress website that will use the Gatherspiel API.</p>
